# MIPS-division
This is a MIPS program that will accept two integers from the user and compute the division.
//Dividend 0
As we know, the dividend value of zero will give us a result of zero. In this case, we will consider this value as the exit of the program and we will call the syscall 10 . 
//Divisor 0
As we know, the division by zero is undefined. Therefore, any our program will be cracked. However, before the operation is computed, we will consider this value as an exit to our program and we will call the syscall 10.
