# MIPS-division
This is a MIPS program that will accept two integers from the user and compute the division.
# Dividend zero
As we know, the dividend value of zero will give us a result of zero. In this case, we will consider this value as the exit of the program. 
# Divisor zero
As we know, the division by zero is undefined. Therefore, any our program will be cracked.
